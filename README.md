## game overview
This game uses a 3rd party pokemon API to gather and list all contained pokemon data and images. This data is then fed onto the page where the user can select one and view its stats.  If the user is registered and logged in, they can try to catch the selected pokemon with their pokeballs.  Once they have caught at least one pokemin, they can do battle with other users wwho have at least one pokemon.  The battle is a simple compare function that picks a winner based on the current users attack points and the selected opponents defense points. If the user wins, they gain a pokeball and their win categoriy increments.  If they lose, they lose a pokeball and their lose category increments.
